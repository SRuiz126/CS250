How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
In order to interpret user needs we must start by asking for feedback from old users and modifying the code accordingly. Also the specific inputs and outputs for the system should be identified. 
User stories are great when we want to find the user needs. User stories help understand the perspective of the end user. It also helps us understand what the user wants and from there we create a simple requirement description.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
We can use the waterfall method which can help in projecting the needs and adopting specific strategies. We can also use Agile if we feel that the client is going to make sudden changes to the requirements. 

The agile processes I hope to incorporate are Scrum and crystal. They offer unique ways to test plan and integrate my work. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
